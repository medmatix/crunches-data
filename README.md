## Crunches-data Site Development Repository
==============================

This is the repository for development of my own personal website. The site functions as my creative face and includes blogs, articles/stories and projects etc.It is all rather cobbled together just now, but I do intend to clean up the site and it's code at some point. It works for me as is however so such housekeeping is very low priorty for me.
