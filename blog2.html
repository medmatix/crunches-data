            <p class="blog-post-meta">October 5, 2014 by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-york-b-sc-m-d-m-b-a/92/b69/227/">David</a></p>

            <p><em>I am making somewhat of a digression in order to talk about my projects. In part because they will include, over time, some 
			tangible responses to the challenges I've discussed I mention the new pages in the blog. So, I have decided to add a new set 
			of pages to the website to post information about my personal projects. Some of these involve development and programming and 
			some are other kinds of activities. I plan to focus today's blog mainly on the application development projects as it gives me a 
			chance to talk about open source and free or non-costly software.</em></p><br>

         
            
            <h3>I Love the Open Source and Community Software Concepts.</h3>
            <p>The open source movement is really, to my mind, a foundation in computer engineering rather than a movement within it. 
				It is the way things were in the beginning and a philosophy. The norm was to share code as ideas (like “free as in speech”, 
				see Darren Wershler-Henry, (2002) Free as in Speech and Beer, Prentice-Hall, Toronto). It was from the get go more than 
				just code because all those patterns we now use daily, search algorithms, sort algorithms, ways of doing things originated 
				again and again in the creative processes the original hackers of the 60s and 70s.</p><br>
				
			<p>My late cousin, Rick, and I spent our entire youth (and beyond) creating and exploring the halls of science and among <em>our</em> 
				discoveries was the computer. Not withstanding the analogue TIC-TAC-TOE computer he built from scratch, Rick's first computer 
				was an Apple kit of sorts(c. 1969). Of course, software as we know it now was nearly non-existent and was for us programs 
				copied by hand from computer ‘mags’ (or ‘Xerox' copies of them from libraries) and stored, if we could, on cassette tape. 
				Often we just typed in the code as we needed in and then ran it. Running programs for college computer courses consisted 
				of delivering your stack of punched cards to the operator in one room and picking out your reams of output in another, 
				debugging and repeating. To avoid line-ups this was usually all done at 2 am. In this setting, our classmates shared great 
				programs with you without question. If you had a physics problem to solve you first checked to see if someone had a FORTRAN 
				routine which helped with the job.</p><br>
			
			<p>Intellectual property has had to become a more concrete concept at the hands of lawyers (of course) and entrepreneurs, 
				in order to measure worth for the purposes commerce. Unfortunately, the entrepreneurs (now, often venture capitalists 
				rather than the creators) and the lawyers fall, more into the business for the sake of business types, rather than 
				business for the builders and users of technology. However as evils go this is on balance a necessary one. At the same 
				time, the concept of open source and "free as in speech" has needed increasingly aggressive defence. The fact that 
				"free as in beer" is what todays naive users and naive lawyers think is the issue 'muddies' the conflict further.</p><br>
			
			<p>All that being considered we now find the two camps, unnecessarily always suspicious of each other, and I am in the 
				open source camp (in case you still weren’t clear on that). This begins to touch on the difficult to pin down definition(s)
				of when ideas should be able to be reserved as sole personal property and when and how they are part of the commons (see Garrett 
				Hardin, “The Tragedy of the Commons”  Science, December 13, 1968). This is also a discussion I intend to reserve for a 
				future ‘Millerean Rant’ rather than explore it now.  Nuff Said!</p> 
			
			<p>Incidentally, I read an interesting essay yesterday about “what the top 1% of software engineers do”. This ventures among 
				other things, the generally untested opinion that a significant proportion of these are represented in open source projects. 
				Notwithstanding the implied comment on the state of the art, this is consistent with my own opinion about the creative 
				‘volksgeist’ in all this.</p><br>
            
			<h3>A bit about the Cost and Accessibility of Software.</h3>
			
			<p>In my experience more frequently than not software tools are beyond the reach and resources of users with need. While 
				commercial software pricing is very much out of control for legitimate users, I believe  the open source software movement 
				serves as a balancing force in the market for user rights. This is particularly important for the academic and not-for-profit  
				sectors. Also I think that the work going on in open source software is more likely to return rewards of effort to the software 
				creators and builders. This is truly the impetus for me to be in this camp (beyond any politics of course).</p>
				
			<p>So, as I have said, my project list has become part of my website. The current list can be seen in detail at <a href= "projects.html">
				Projects</a>.</p>
				
			<p>When one visits a project web site such as on the <a href="">Apache Foundation</a> site a description of the project, usually 
				with a brief background and various discussions of the release history and application or package documentation is encountered. 
				My intent is to share my learning process as well as the development process involved in the project’s progress. I assume 
				the sharing of what I learned about the object oriented development paradigm and my research process into the domain area 
				of the project may be of benefit to other learners as a (hopefully, positive) development example as a didactic exercise. 
				As a result the way I have used the Unified Process is documented proceed step by step for my project 1 (DPSS). Whether I 
				repeat this idea with other projects I am posting depends on the value other find in the exercise. I certainly forces me 
				the think rigorously about how I am carrying out my development. I also hope some useful dialogue is generated as well.</p>
			
			<p>So I invite the reader to visit the Projects page and see how my project 1 is unfolding. Feedback, comments and discussion 
				are enthusiastically welcomed, email to, "infmtx.feedback@gmail.com". This is also the otherwise unheralded addition of feedback 
				functionality to my site in general, and to this blog in particular.</p>

            <p>This site is evolving and today I use the blog to introduce some of the changes in the website.<br>I want to share my interests by adding a venue 
				to discuss projects I have planned, over and above the contracting I do. So the discussion centers around the new Projects pages 
				and my reasons for supporting open source software.</p>
			<p>Also, added functionality is introduced as an email address to allow comments and to affect the direction of discussions.</p>
