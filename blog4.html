			<h2 class="blog-post-title">Who’s going to care for the patient (and how)?</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 18, 2014 by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-york-b-sc-m-d-m-b-a/92/b69/227/">David</a></p>

            <p>A woefully misunderstood and clearly under appreciated
			   medical record concept is the treatment plan. It is often subsumed under the
			   heading of “disposition” on in electronic record systems where clinicians themselves
			   seem to have tacked it on to a contact note as an apparent a few words of after-thought.</p>
			   <br>

			<p>For a moment, let’s use the <a
			href="http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNEdWebGuide/EMDOC.html">CMS</a>
			Guidelines for Documentation of Evaluation and Management (E &amp; M) Services to
			summarize (for now) what a medical record consists of.</p><
			br>

			<p>The Guidelines central purpose served different ends from a clinician’s
			record of medical care. They were in the end analogous (dare I say
			complementary?). The motivation for the guidelines had entirely different
			philosophies and goals. It is extremely important to bear this in mind whenever
			assessing an implementation of an electronic medical or health record
			(EMP/EHR).  In their design, the guidelines served as a principle part of the
			analysis of requirements.</p>
			<br>

			<p>The problem oriented medical record (<a
			href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5648608">POMR</a>) as <a
			href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4934176">developed</a>, and <a
			href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872343">evolved</a>, provides an
			extensible record of care and a database of the patient’s medical state. It is
			a data repository and medical decision tool. The documentation of E &amp; M
			services is a minimum requirement of documentation for payer auditors
			(specifically federal government Medicare auditors, and their agents) showing that
			billed care meets the requirement for payment as actual services rendered. Thus
			I state that, not-withstanding claims otherwise, it is primarily a government
			auditing document. Although, usurped in many cases by private sector payers for
			the same purposes. Further many others have adapted it for use as a
			documentation guideline, in lieu of a medically standardized expectation of
			data content and organization for information storage and communication. </p>
			<br>

			<p>It remains to be seen whether the E &amp; M Documentation
			guideline is up to the task of medical recording database standard, arbiter of
			medical communication content or even a suitable substitute for the a current
			incarnation of the POMR. My sense is that it does not address the needs brought
			to light by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). This is particularly true concerning
			treatment planning that moves through “patient time”. There was originally no
			intention for the Guidelines to serve that role. Any effect it has had on
			record quality in general is coincidental to the economic need to ensure (under
			threat of federal punishment <sup>1</sup> that one “gets what one has paid for”. </p>
			<br>

			<p>I never tire of referring to the IOM Report “<a
			href="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/1999/To-Err-is-Human-Building-A-Safer-Health-System.aspx">To
			Err is Human</a>”. I feel it is one of the most far reaching and significant
			reports on the state of medicine since perhaps the Flexner report. The main
			observation is that communication problems are the single most important threat
			to a successful patient outcome – certainly while in hospital. I submit that an
			economically motivated document (such as “The Guidelines”) has never in history
			had this potential effect for the human condition.</p>
			<br>

			<p>The field of healthcare in general continues to be rife with
			opportunities for patient care to fall through cracks in the system. A major
			implication of the report is that neither medical skill, competence, nor the
			availability of modern technology is irrelevant to the communication deficit
			involved.  Improved communication alone can seal most of the leaks in health care
			quality; communication everywhere the patient is or will be, among whomever the
			patient must meet, as often and consistently as possible. In particular the
			movement of the patient between episodes of care in the outpatient setting must
			be recognized as a weakness.  I believe a high yield solution for this weakness
			is the complete, comprehensive, frequently revised and revisited, and widely
			available treatment plan. It may very well be more important than a diagnosis
			alone!</p>
			<br>

			<p>Diagnoses can be incomplete, in process, or outright wrong
			and the patient can still receive good care <sup>2</sup>.
			Litigators take note! A well developed, frequently revisited and revised
			treatment plan (which does include of course a working diagnosis) is actually
			the story about what is being done and why at any instant. Such a 3 point plan
			as: continue meds, get test and return next week (or more often, “if not
			better”) does grave disservice to our patients. A foremost omission is “<i>what</i>
			will we be focusing on, or doing, next visit”. Recall from a previous Blog, my
			frequent encounter with the patient complaint “they didn’t even know why I was
			there”. Certainly this clinician embarrassment must, if nothing else does,
			justify a properly written Treatment Plan”.  (This would be so even if the note
			was only for your use – which it is not!). </p>
			<br>

			<p>So, what view of the patient’s treatment should be
			constructed and maintained?</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>>A general statement of the clinician’s thinking is helpful to all
				involved in care – not a sign of indecision for litigators to jump on in court.</li>

				<li>A statement of anticipation of the course of the condition disease or
				disorder is also helpful in both establishing a baseline and a measure of
				response expected to interventions.</li>

				<li>A summary of interventions taken (started) and planned at that current
				phase of the therapeutic process. These include therapies, tests, and goal of
				any intervening period of observation (or benign neglect) and including
				criteria to make deviations from these interventions.</p>

				<li>A statement summarizing for the patient in their own (layman’s) language
				the information contained in ii and iii above. (A detailed patient education
				update).</p>

				<li>A summary of tasks and activities to be completed by the time of the
				next meeting. </li>

				<li>A date and time for the next meeting and criteria of how and why to
				alter follow-up arrangements.</li>

				<li>A list of other persons booked (appointments being arranged etc.) or
				known to be involved in care directly (and indirectly, e.g. Patient disclosed
				alternative therapists) at that current time.</li>

				<li>Who is back-up for the period of the pending next visit if you are not
				available.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Many of these will be default entries such as back-up but
			are included explicitly for others consulting the current the version of the
			plan. Other entries may be selected from lists. Many entries such as thought
			processes are best entered in an ad hoc fashion.</p><br>

			<p>The intention of the patient visit and educational summary
			is to anticipate and answer things that occur to the patient after the end of
			the meeting. However, we must recognize that the patient has a fundamental
			right of access to the full contents of their clinical record. There is a
			proviso, however, that the rare (usually psychiatrically motivated) concern for
			harm to a patient or others by such full disclosure can override such a right.
			With that in mind,+ a non-clinical addendum (<u>Warning to the Patient</u>
			requesting such details) should always be present explaining the speculative
			nature, pending further information or the fullness of time, of some of the
			content of the Therapeutic Plan. This is not intended as a legal disclaimer at
			all but a service to the patient; but indeed does also serve a disclaimer role
			if ever needed.</p><br>

			<p>All that remains for me is to consider templates and other
			tools to assist in this model of a therapeutic plan. I am developing these, as
			part of my projects, to be a logical part of a generic, care directed, and
			clinical record. Such a clinical data source is also the precursor of the
			database available for data analysis that we want to carry out. This clinical
			data should be compatible with all the business management, the third party
			accounting and payment, and economic and health policy needs. Thus clinical
			care coexists with these needs with-in an informatics instrument and primarily
			addresses clinical, biomedical, and direct patient care needs. This demonstrates
			the many stakeholders in such a system.</p>
			<br>

			<h4>Notes: </h4>
			<p style="font-size:15px"><sup>1</sup>The recording of services in keeping with the E & M Services guideline is part of the obligation a "biller for 
			   service" has in receiving payment for an insured service.</p>
			<p style="font-size:15px"><sup>2</sup> See also the history and content of other para-clinical data collection and coding standards such as the

			   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> (DSM-n). This coding system developed to aid in statistical analysis. It is often applied without full regard

			   <a href="http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?paperID=50487#.VGzoWcn4KSo">legal</a> contexts.It deserves exploration of the inappropriate use in its own right. All are fodder for future blogs.</p>

            <p>There are advantages to being on the outside looking into the system when the patients are gathered around you, as a peer, and share their stories and concerns about how they are receiving care from the system.</p>
			<p>Among the insights I get is the state of the patient, in their own mind and in the record of their encounter. Between my recollections of sharing in the care of patients and these new insights, live new ideas for me to develop.</p>
			<p>What we write about our patient meeting is ultimately the data we analyse. Time spent looking at the recording of the data is always well spend.</p>
