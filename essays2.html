	  <h2 align="center" style="color:blue">The Umami Sensation: the beauty and the beast of food additives</h2>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:blue"><em>There is a new taste in town! Umami.</em></h3>
	  <p>Well, not so new for those steeped in the culinary arts but not known generally to be a basic taste sensation. By basic I mean there is a 
	     single, identifiable neuroanatomical structure called a taste receptor or “bud” that is stimulated when one or more chemical groups or 
		 molecules is attached to it. The result is the four original sensations of salty, sweet, sour and bitter are expanded to five. Of course, 
		 there is also a strong contribution to our perception of taste from our sense of smell (olfaction), which is much more complex in nature 
		 than the simple basic tastes.</p>
	  <p>The sensation of taste consists of those five components mentioned. Classically, the four "original" basic tastes are sweet, salty, bitter 
	     and sour. In 1909, a Japanese chemist, Prof. K. Ikeda, discovered that there was a fifth basic taste sensation related to the perception of 
	     savory. He found this was due to the stimulation of a taste bud receptor on the tongue by the amino acid L-glutamate the salt of L-glutamic 
	     acid. Ikeda related taste to the addition of kelp to traditional disks in Japan and Korea. Umami is a loan word (or 
		 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calque">calque</a>) from the Japanese where it translates as: "pleasant savory sensation". </p>
	  <p>Note this discovery did not suddenly impel Chinese Restaurants to begin adding mono-sodium glutamate (MSG) to takeout. Traditional cooking 
	     techniques and condiments all over the world enhance the L-Glutamate content of food. Well-known source additives are hoisin sauce, soy sauce, 
	     Worcester (or <a href="http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/worcesterorworcestershiresauce.htm">Worcestershire</a>) sauce, tomato paste, dried mushrooms and anchovies. The predominance of fermentation in the 
		 preparation of many of these sources is not accidental. The making of these umami ingredients involves the release or concentration of 
		 L-glutamate.</p>
	  <p>Proteins are a polymer (a chain made up of many smaller repeating units) of amino acids. The amino acids composing a protein (its primary 
	     structure) yield up its behavior. Some protein sources make up foods ‘rich’ in glutamate. It is interesting that fewer vegetables, except the 
	     noteworthy tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic and onion, are found without alteration on our list. Meats and fish are high in glutamate but do need 
	     some preparation to yield the desired favor, like cooking.</p>
	  <p>So, what then is a strict vegan to do? Well, remember our friend soy sauce, it is a pure vegetable source. Consider also the creative use of tomato paste. Worcestershire Sauce is vegetable . . . plus anchovies. However, it is also available in low and non-fish containing varieties for those who are vegan, allergic to fish and for kosher diets (where fish and meat may not be eaten at the same meal).</p>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:blue"><em>So what is this important sensation of umami really all about?</em></h3>
	  <p>I mentioned glutamate but as one might expect, the story is not so straightforward. The strongest umami sensation is a result of the binding of 
	     both glutamate and inosine to the umami receptor on the tongue. Glutamate binding, alone will give a weaker stimulation of the receptors. It 
		 was clarified over time that umami was actually a synergic effect on the tongue of both glutamate, an amino acid salt, and inosine, a purine 
		 nucleoside - like those that makeup the chains of DNA and RNA. Inosine is however not part of the genetic code of any known organism on earth. </p>
	  <p>As an interesting digression, and at the risk of “putting you off your feed”; natural metabolic processes can alter the ‘purine’ nucleosides 
	    adenosine and guanosine, which do occur in DNA and RNA, to yield up inosine. Incidentally, the other two genetic units, cytosine and thymidine 
	  (  uracil in RNA) do not metabolize normally into inosine but ultimately to uric acid, the cause of gout.</p>
	  <p>Thus, Inosine is a fermentation product, along with glutamate, in the sauces mentioned. Adding inosine to glutamate greatly increases the sensation of savory on the tongue. The process in tomato paste is an example of the simple process of concentration during its preparation. </p>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:blue"><em>Even if umami has a function, is it good for you?</em></h3>
	  <p>Umami has additional significance due to a central role of this sensation in satiety - the sensation of hunger relieved. Carbohydrate, simple 
	     sugars and the more complex starches, do not have this satiation effect in our brains. Fats do not have this effect in the mouth either, but 
		 do produce satiety from effects in the stomach.  </p>
	  <p>Awareness of the taste of foods is even more complex due the involvement of the sense of smell in our appreciation of the food in our mouths.
	     After all, the nasal cavity is widely joined with the back of our oral cavity, allowing the smell of food to blend with taste in our consciousness 
		 to yield a broad range of subjective responses to our diet.</p>
	  <p>None of the other four tastes contribute as significantly to our satisfaction with food - witness the addictive nature of our sweet and salty 
	     snacks and our over-indulgence in them.  Driven to satisfy our hunger we have sought endlessly among chocolate bars, ice cream and potato 
		 chips when all we needed was some seaweed.</p>
	  <p>Umami is not the only gateway to the ‘satiety center’ in the underside (the hypothalamus) of the brain. As I alluded, fat in a meal slows 
	     stomach (gastric) emptying and gives the feeling of satiety. Further, hunger and satiety are aspects of that larger emotional state called 
		 libido, whose elements closely interconnect in the mind. That is a story, I reserve perhaps, for another occasion.</p>
	  
	  <h3 style="color:blue"><em>“Please Joe, say it ain’t so!”</em></h3>
	  <p>Those who are interested can explore the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">chemistry of glutamate and purine nucleosides</a>
	     (inosine) and <a href="http://blog.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2009/02/20/umami-the-5th-taste/">umami</a> at length. However, a word of caution is 
		 in order concerning a huge mythology where food and its chemistry are concerned. Some <a href="http://preventdisease.com/home/tips100.shtml">sources on the web</a> 
		 have erroneously discussed L-glutamate and D-glutamate as if they were naturalness and the evil twin. The amino acids of the protein of all life on 
		 earth are in the L-form (beyond the D, L- distinction itself, the terminology is confusing and can be avoided here). This has to do with the stereoscopic 
		 structure at the first carbon atom (the alpha), and what is apparently the evolutionary uniqueness of ancestral terrestrial life forms (another 
		 story). It suffices to say, D-glutamate comes from non-living sources. Not bad per se but certainly not an issue of food but of drug. The 
		 distinction of D and L- glutamate as additives blurs a lot, unfortunately.</p>
	  <p>When man or non-living nature cause the chemical synthesis of substances, and there exists a center of stereoscopic asymmetry, the D and L 
	     forms occur in a statistically even mix. Thus, the living organism will react to the L-stereoisomer of any amino acid in its ‘intended’ or 
		 expected fashion, at any particular location in the body. The response to D-stereoisomers is not inherently good or bad just not as would 
		 be physiologically predictable. What we know of as MSG is artificially synthesized and so is at best a 50-50 mixture (called racemic). 
		 D-glutamate causes altered or exaggerated responses but it does also produce some of the effect of savory at the tongue. It also tends to cause more flushing and such in the body. Many reasons are involved, which would include that organisms metabolize D-glutamate differently in comparison to L-glutamate. Further, recall that co-binding of inosine with L-glutamate enhances the effect of much lower levels of glutamate at the tongue.</p>
	  <p>Further, I have read some discussions of concerns with high glutamate foods being toxic, which are at best way-simplistic and at worst far 
	     out in left field (vis-a-vis poppycock). The toxicity questions are very complex and we must consider both the context of the effects and 
		 cause-effect assumptions, which are, too often, arbitrary. While it is true that blood starved (ischemic) tissue death (like in a stroke) 
		 releases high amounts of glutamate, this is hardly the physiologic response to a balanced diet. </p>
	  <p>Fuel in my car is good; spread on my lawn is bad. Context is important. Finding pollution bad for the neighborhood is not a statement about 
	     the polluting substances themselves simple about the location. Questions of causation are even more difficult to prove, and are misleading 
		 if simple association is the criterion. Statistical proof is not proof of cause when control of the context is impossible. (Another huge 
		 story.) </p>
	  <p>I recall one website touting the virtue of corn as being low in glutamate, but at the same time apparently unaware of the fact that (unaltered) 
	     corn proteins are among the least nutritionally available to humans (and dogs), in the plant kingdom. However, that is another story for me 
		 to write for you as well.</p>
	  <p>Metabolism of ‘dietary L-glutamic acid’ is as effective in the normal animal as the metabolism of any of the amino acids. It is not normal to 
	     find circulating free-amino acids, which can effect nerve contacts and cause the toxicities dreamed of by some, because the organism has 
		 mechanisms to ensure against it. The liver packages the products of digestion in order to carry them harmlessly throughout the body. </p>
	  <p>Between the highly bound form of amino acids in serum proteins and the presence of an intact barrier between the circulating blood and the 
	     fluid around the brain (blood-brain barrier), it is not the norm to find free amino acids causing rampant nervous hyperstimulation. Recall 
		 though that the liver cannot simply incorporate D-glutamate into proteins (though it can metabolize D-glutamate to sugar). Thus ‘free-
		 unincorporated’ D-glutamate is more likely to occur in circulation, and “totally free” D-glutamate in serum solution occurs when there is too 
		 much to be physically adsorbed on to serum proteins as a drug would be. </p>
	  <p>So, man-made food chemicals bad, mother-nature-made chemicals good (e.g. by fermentation) - sort of. High L-glutamic acid foods yummy (and 
	     satisfying), low L-glutamic acid foods yucky (for many reasons). ‘Racemic’ or D-MSG not only bad, but also probably unnecessary with proper 
		 condiment and recipe ingredient selection.is concerned and compare them to natures own experimentation along with , which we call evolution 
		 as well as man's more "arms-length" manipulations such as animal husbandry and breeding.</p>
