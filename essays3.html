        <p class="lead" align="left">Well, my family are definitely strong on opinions. I was prompted to explore the facts and fears about genetic 
		   engineering of our foods (and other things) after some of our spirited discussions. Fear of the unknown or the new is a major force 
		   in human behavior (and opinion). There are some adaptive reasons for this but I think few are especially positive. I consider knowledge and 
		   understanding the best antidote for fear of the new. So here is my contribution to that end.</p><br>

	  <br>
	  
		<p>Greg likes to grow peas in his garden.  He has noticed that there are two color types of what he is growing: green and yellow.  He has also 
		   noticed that their surfaces may be different.  They may be either smooth or wrinkled.  But, there’s a lot of time to think you while you are 
		   growing garden peas.  While watching peas role and thinking Greg noticed that round piece always gave round peas when replanted but recalled 
		   peas might give round or recalled Peas when replanted.  He also noticed that green peas always gave green peas by yellow might grow yellow 
		   or green peas. He experimented with cross-pollination of plants with peas with different characteristics. He learned he could control the pea 
		   seed characteristics.</p>

		<p>It is not an overstatement that all of genetics and genetic re-engineering have evolved from these simple observations and controlled pollinations made by a monk, working in his garden, 200 years ago1.  The significance is that breeding dogs and horses, getting the best wheat to grow in cold climates, and learning one’s chances of passing on a serious family affliction are all possible because of the kind of observations Brother Mendel made.</p>

		<h3>“We always have to monkey with things don’t we?”?</h3>
		<p>The phrase “monkey around” is certainly apt where Man is concerned. It implies that Man, the ape, comes by his need to manipulate things rather naturally. But, most often, man himself does not consider the products his own manipulations to be natural at all. Now that we bring it up, what is this "natural" thing and why is it good, while we consider man’s exploratory manipulations to be bad. We should explore these issues, particularly where genetic engineering is concerned.</p>

		<p>Let’s face it we do just do not trust the involvement of mankind, in anything. There is a pervasive fear that mankind with our manipulations and interference with Mother Nature has veered badly off at the rails.  If this is indeed the case, where was it that we began to go wrong, and how do continuing actions of man compound our problems?  We’ll not pursue the question of original sin, the naturally evil nature of man and the many philosophies of self-loathing.</p>

		<p>I must set some other ground rules right from the start as well.  I am going to assume not only that it is impossible for us to all return to Eden but that there was never cause for us to do so.  At the risk of everything I say flying in the face of fundamentalist thinking it is my premise that our natures as inquiring beasts means we should continue free and unrestrained inquiry.  Please note that I’m not saying that we should continue free and unrestrained doing.  The reason for this particular proviso is that we have a history of doing too much of the latter without enough of the former.</p>

		<p>Therefore I am writing with the understanding that there’s only one reason at all to consider. This is to make our food grow better here where we and those we care for live our lives.</p>

		<h3>The story of Canadian wheat is a story of development of cold and pest adapted crops.</h3>
		<p>Wheat is a multiploid grass that originated in the Levant (Asia Minor).  From the outset is very difficult to determine man’s role in its evolution or development.  Polypoidy, the condition of being multploid or having more than two pairs of chromosomes and it occurs and extremely commonly in nature particularly in plants.  Diploid (a pair of each chromosome) is the normal condition, and haploid is the state in gametes or sex cells.</p>

		<p>It is in the multiploid state that grasses have become a staple food stuff for the world.  We most often observe that more than two copies of a full set of chromosomes can increase adaptability and robustness of organisms. (However, having too many copies of a subset of chromosomes is in general a bad thing, and is frequently lethal to the possessor.) It’s no wonder that polyploidy is among the best example of nature’s own genetic manipulations.</p>

		<p>Jared Diamond has discussed the importance of plant adaptation to climate and geography to the spread of civilization in his book Guns Germs and Steel.4  According to Diamond, the rate of food plant adaptability to new environments has paced migrations throughout history. He notes further, that North-south adaptation is much slower than East-West adaptation. When Europeans settled in North America they brought with them their own food and for the most part the means of growing more of it.  But on arrival in North America some plants were ill prepared for their new environment, particularly when colonies were significantly different in latitude from home, and selection for suitability from new growth was ultimately necessary for civilization to thrive in the new world.</p>

		<p>In its early years Canada was not an agriculture dependent country.  Its strengths lie in its natural resources of minerals timber and animal pelts.  In order to have a strong agricultural base, crops were necessary that others, particularly in foreign markets, desired at harvest.  The demand for wheat, oats, and barley are ubiquitous and they have always been stable cash crops.  But wheat is not particularly cold resistant and yields often suffer in freezing conditions.  Further, the pests with which plants have to contend vary by region.  Then in 1842 a Scottish farmer named Fife in Canada received seeds of wheat from home, reportedly Turkish origins5.  These grew very well in his new home and he shared seed with his neighbors.</p>

		<p>In the opening of the west to agriculture cold freezing winters and into new pests prompted the Canadian government to sponsor research to develop hardier strains of wheat.  This was a program so successful that Canada ranks with the top wheat producers in the world.  Was this genetic manipulation?  Certainly chromosomes were manipulated, whereby Mother Nature was influenced in her perfidy by allowing only certain cross pollinations to occur and propagate.</p>

		<h3>My sister-in-law loves her bull mastiff.</h3>
		<p>But she is among the stauncher opponents of genetically engineered food. Her reported reasons are characteristic of the opponents to “non-organic” food. My sister uses much of the same argument which I think boils down to it being “unnatural”. This argument is as vague and incongruous as the reference to “non-organic” food. But my sister-in law lovers her mastiff. She’s currently on her third mastiff and it’s, rightly so, a central member of the family. Interestingly it is probably one of the least genetically manipulated of the dogs existing today. It is a cross6 of the Old English Bulldog and the English Mastiff. But, a cross it is and likely the English Mastiff7 is as well though likely much farther back into antiquity. Also, it could be, perhaps, a landrace, originally created by nature and environment spontaneously, rather than a breed created through man’s machinations. Of course, by current organic logic the former is okay and the latter is not.</p>

		<p>I am a dog owner and lover as too and in my case it is golden retrievers. This is a breed derived from a single breeding pair of a yellow wavy coated retriever and a Tweed Water Spaniel (with later inclusion of Irish Setter, Bloodhound and further Tweed Water Spaniel stock).  We are on our third and fourth and the youngest is in some ways my daily lesson on the more uncontrolled outcomes of man’s husbandry. The have all been of wonderful loving and gentle natures but our youngest is high strung and anxious. He is a daily chore to deal with but underneath it all he is a lovey sweet boy who simply needs everyone’s attention. I am so sad though when he is in one of his tortured states of excitement. Then, more than any other time I can sympathize with my sister’s and sister-in-law’s perspectives.</p>

		<p>However it is important to note that much of this genetic misadventure is an example of other traits of man: greed, and refusal to consider outside advice (among others). The refusal in question is that of considering the wider and longer term effects of getting a dog in the general population neutered. The result is wild uncontrolled experiments of nature and a very large population of unwanted dogs. The greed is the precursor to the puppy mill phenomenon which allows another example of uncontrolled “breeding”. But these are the extreme and unsavory examples of mankind’s foolhardiness and the capriciousness of nature. The question of good or bad in this case, is not about issues of animal husbandry but to something else entirely.</p>

		<h3>Breeding true vs. Elimination of bad or inclusion of desired traits, and who decides?</h3>
		<p>When carrying out selective breeding, one is choosing more abstract characteristics rather than specific genes or gene combinations to guide the pairing of sire and dame. In genetic manipulation, the genes themselves or more simply, we substitute the chromosomes that hold them into the genome of an organism in the place of the one currently present. The key is; we know the entity (gene(s) or chromosome) holds the trait desired (though the entity removed may not be known to express any specific form of the trait – it is just waste).</p>

		<p>Lastly we enter the realm, in my classification model, of genetic engineering. Here a gene is altered directly to some known and specific sequence of nucleotides (adenosine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine). The gene may cut out and a replacement spliced in order to add a copy of the gene in as extra code where the gene has never existed before.</p>

		<p>An important distinction is, in some sense, the novelty of the gene or its products (proteins). If we are for instance substituting the trait of yellow coat for black coat we are merely using microscopic technology to do what animal husbandry does in the large. The advantage is less uncertainty. While egg cells may be discarded due to manipulation errors, whole animals (and plants) are discarded for breeding errors. Which is better is a philosophical question I am not addressing here but the issues are very deep and emotionally charged.</p>

		<h3>When does it matter how we pursue improved traits?</h3>
		<p>Clearly beans and peas do not consent to these manipulations. Whose consent is needed in any case of manipulation? To what extent must a sentient being be affected, to be an active stakeholder in a manipulation? I can’t answer these issues for anyone but myself. I believe equal caution is indicated when any living thing is a party to the activity – genetic or otherwise. This is the realm of ethics and is the appropriate arena for the debate.</p>
		
		<p>Neither is this an ethical treatise nor a legal one. It is an exploration of whether genetic manipulation is different from what is historically husbandry or agriculture and whether it differs in any significant way from the natural process of adaptive change and evolution. But the question of harm and what is harmful is always a silent attendant to this discussion. Read on and I will show that little, if indeed any, of genetic engineering is any different from processes not involving man’s ministrations. The products of the manipulations are no more or less harmful in man’s hands than in natures. </p>


		<h3>What about the search for entirely new traits not in a variety or species to begin with?</h3>
		<p>New trait introduction is not only a purview of mankind’s genetic engineering repertoire. Consider the natural acquisition of antibiotic resistance by one bacterial species from another species. Bacteria, loosely speaking, have bacterial sex. This is bacterial conjugation<sup>8</sup> and it results from contact between distinct cells, directly or by a connecting structure, with passage of genetic material between the independent organisms. Microbiologists discovered conjugation as a cause of transmission of resistance to antibiotics among gram negative bacteria (E coli, etc.). Scientists initially thought conjugation was a species specific activity (E. coli to E. col) but then it was found occurring between distinct gram negative organisms (e.g. E. coli to S. marcens).</p>
		
		<p>In the 1970s, physicians observed a toxic shock syndrome. Scientists determined it was due to gram-positive Staphylococcus produced enterotoxin B. new tampons Contaminated during packaging exposed women to the toxin or toxin producing staph. Later the observation of was made that enterotoxin B producing Streptococcus contaminating wounds caused toxic shock syndrome also. Clearly some mechanism had passed the genetic material coding for the toxin in Staph to the Strep. The same acquisition pathways later resulted in Group A Strep acquiring the enzymatic toxin causing “flesh-eating-disease”.</p>
		
		<p>Examples of free, non-sexual passage of genetic material among cells of even widely disparate types are common in scientific literature. Some viruses (like the herpes virus) are particularly adept at inserting DNA into the genome of their host. It is the adaptation of this mechanism which has become the commonly used tool of genetic engineering. The bottom line is that if genetic material freely floating in the environment is very common and available to be picked up and incorporated into an organism’s genome. Once there, an organism can use it, or it can cause disease. Further single celled organisms are extruding free DNA into the environment constantly. All this is without man’s intervention or involvement, at all.</p>
		
		<p>The vast majority of genetic manipulations are the same activities under the control of man rather than by chance alone. Consider the desire to manufacture a biologically active protein such as insulin. The alternative is to obtain it by the sacrifice of animals (secondary to food production). The result was the introduction of the DNA for human insulin into E. coli which produces it in great quantities as part of its regular metabolic work. A phage virus from nature introduced the gene into the bacteria.</p>
		
		<p>The next level of genetic engineering is when we determine a defect of inefficient region of a gene. We are now able to switch the defect back to the proper form or delete it entirely. We are able then to use the same techniques to introduce the corrected gene back into the genome, improving or correcting its functioning. Finally we may theorize that a radical change to produce an entirely new gene can add a function not available to an organism before. It may work as per theory or it may not but it is the same kind of experiment carried out in nature all the time. It is just directed by the mind or man, not random chance.</p>
		
		<p>As a digression, a question here should pose itself immediately. How new is new, and who owns the new? Further can and should the owner control who gets the gene if DNA is naturally and constantly extruded into the environment. It is not the intent of this discussion to explore the vagaries and jurisprudence of intellectual properly. BUT the ability and responsibility of the owner to control the travels of their gene is germane to that discussion.</p>


		<h3>Husbandry, Stewardship and Genetics</h3>
		<p>The issue isn’t whether we can control what is going on around us. These things are going to be done. It is far more effective to reach a social and ethical consensus on action than create a yet another new crime. (That is a perhaps rather alien approach these days). It is a matter of judgement and ethics which are always to be seen in shades of grey.</p>

		<p>The first step over the invisible line is to argue we should do things simply because we can. This is often an explanation of how it will come to pass that a human will be cloned. However, I believe that can never responsibly or even sanely be offered as an explanation as to why it should be done. This is an important distinction to be made and repeated.</p>

		<p>There is a lot of grey in such discussions that need constant study and exposure. I point for example to the patenting of genes, such as for genetically modified corn. The pros and cons of patents are well handled elsewhere with merit on both sides. Never the less, it is not the commercial success of a manipulation and who it belongs to that is the defining issue but the risk-benefit assessment (and its constant reassessment). This may seem the same thing but failure to take the time to understand the distinction (and to understand  why) is really the source of the fears of my sister-in-law and her peers. The engineered food is not bad – Mother Nature engineers it too, usually just more slowly.</p><br>
